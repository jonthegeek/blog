![](/post/2019-05-11-introducing-factory_files/factory.png){style="float:right;padding:10px;"} Function factories are, in my opinion, one of the cooler concepts in programming. A function factory is a function that produces a function. A straightforward example function factory (from  [*Advanced R* (second edition) by Hadley Wickham](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/function-factories.html)) is a power function factory, which can be used to produce functions that raise their input to a specific power. You'd probably never actually use this exact factory, but it gets the general idea across:

```{r power1}
power1 <- function(exp) {
  function(x) {
    x ^ exp
  }
}

square <- power1(2)
cube <- power1(3)

square(3)
cube(3)
```

However, there's a reason that particular factory is named `power1` in *Advanced R*. That factory is fragile:

```{r power1 fragility}
y <- 2
square <- power1(y)
y <- 3
square(2)
```

Since `y` changed before we called `square`, `square` didn't work how we expected it to work. You can get around this by `force`ing the input to evaluate:

```{r power2}
power2 <- function(exp) {
  force(exp)
  function(x) {
    x ^ exp
  }
}

y <- 2
square <- power2(y)
y <- 3
square(2)
```

That requirement makes function factories a bit more complicated to code. For an extreme example, see [this pull request to the `scales` package](https://github.com/r-lib/scales/pull/81), which took almost two years to get everything nailed down.

Even when you remember to force evaluation of variables inside the factory, the function produced by a factory isn't quite what you might expect it to be:

```{r square2 body}
square
```

Looking at that code, you can't really tell what the function does. What is `exp`? How does the function know that it's `2`? To figure that out, you need to dig into the environment that's displayed when you print `square`. It would be nicer if the output of a factory was a *normal* function that users could then adapt and work with like any other function.

The `{rlang}` package solves this problem by introducing the function `new_function` (as described in [Advanced R by Hadley Wickham (2nd Edition), 19.7.4: Creating functions](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/quasiquotation.html#new-function)):

```{r power3}
power3 <- function(exp) {
  rlang::new_function(
    rlang::exprs(x = ), 
    rlang::expr({
      x ^ !!exp
    }), 
    rlang::caller_env()
  )
}

y <- 2
square <- power3(y)
y <- 3
square(2)

square
```

Now the resulting function looks like any other function... but we've just moved the complexity from the factory user to the factory author.

My goal with [`{factory}`](https://github.com/jonthegeek/factory) is to make factory creation easy for both the author and user.

```{r power4}
library(factory)
power4 <- build_factory(
  fun = function(x) {
    x^exp
  },
  exp
  # For the time being, you need to tell factory which arguments 
  # belong to the factory.
)

x <- 2
square <- power4(x)
x <- 3
square(2)

square
```

The function is as easy to write as in `power1`, and the resulting function is a "normal" function as in `power3`.

With help from [Colin Fay](https://twitter.com/_ColinFay), I'm currently working on adding an Rstudio addin to `{factory}`, to allow you to select some code (an instance of what you expect as output from a factory) and convert it into a factory. I also plan to add an addin to make it easy to use a factory while creating a package (a [whole other can of worms](https://github.com/r-lib/gargle/pull/58)), but that will wait for a future blog post.

Do you have any function factory use cases? Let me know here, or, more importantly, in a [`{factory}` issue](https://github.com/jonthegeek/factory/issues)!

```{r meme}
library(memer)
meme_get("YoDawg") %>% 
  meme_text_top(
    txt = toupper("Yo dawg I herd you like function factories"), 
    size = 24
  ) %>%  
  meme_text_bottom(
    txt = toupper(
      paste(
        "so we put a function factory in a function factory",
        "so you can automate while you automate",
        sep = "\n"
      )
    ), 
    size = 22
  )
```
